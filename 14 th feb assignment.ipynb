    "1-Parallel processing: The threading module can be used to speed up computations by running them in parallel on multiple threads.\n",

When join() is called on a thread, the main program will pause until the thread has finished executing. This is useful when you want to synchronize the execution of multiple threads, or when you need to ensure that a thread has completed before performing some other operation.\n",

    "A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources that they need in order to proceed. In other words, each process is holding a resource that the other process needs, and neither can proceed without the other releasing the resource. This can result in a situation where all processes are effectively \"stuck\" and cannot make progress. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, and can result in system crashes or other issues.\n",

    "A race condition, on the other hand, occurs when two or more processes access shared resources in a way that produces unexpected results. Specifically, the order in which the processes access the resources can affect the outcome of the program. This can occur when one process modifies a resource while another process is reading or modifying it, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results. Race conditions can be difficult to reproduce and diagnose, and can lead to program crashes, data corruption, and other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both deadlocks and race conditions are examples of concurrency issues, which can arise in multi-threaded or multi-process environments where multiple processes or threads are executing simultaneously. To avoid these issues, developers must carefully design their programs to ensure that resources are accessed in a safe and predictable manner, and implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, or message passing.\n",
