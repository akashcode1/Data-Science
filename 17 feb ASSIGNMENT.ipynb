    "MongoDB is a popular open-source document-oriented NoSQL database that uses a flexible JSON-like document format for storing and querying data. It provides a flexible and scalable approach to handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it particularly useful for applications that require fast and flexible access to large amounts of data.\n",

    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to handle unstructured data and do not follow the traditional tabular, relational structure of SQL databases. They allow for more flexible data models and are particularly useful for handling big data, real-time data, and data that is constantly changing. NoSQL databases also provide high availability and scalability, making them ideal for web applications and other large-scale applications.\n",

Additionally, MongoDB is popular for web applications, as it can handle large volumes of data and is easy to use with popular web development frameworks.\n",
