For example, if a variable is nominal, only descriptive statistics like frequencies and percentages can be used, while if it is ratio, more complex analyses like regression or t-tests can be performed. If the level of measurement is not properly considered, the statistical analysis may be incorrect or misleading."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "-Mode: the most common value in a dataset. It is the value that appears most frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Measures of variability are used to describe how spread out or dispersed a dataset is. There are several common measures of variability:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Range: the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Variance: a measure of the average distance of each value in a dataset from the mean. It is calculated by summing the squared difference between each value and the mean, and dividing by the total number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Standard deviation: the square root of the variance. It represents the average distance of each value in a dataset from the mean, and is often used as a measure of the \"typical\" amount of variability in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding measures of central tendency and variability is important for interpreting and drawing conclusions from data. For example, if a dataset has a high standard deviation, it indicates that the values are spread out widely from the mean and that there may be a lot of variability in the dataset. If the mean, median, and mode are all similar, it suggests that the dataset is symmetrical and that there are no extreme values."
